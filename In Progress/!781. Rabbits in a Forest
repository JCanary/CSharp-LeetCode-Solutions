/*
Given input array of nums

Count responses, send to dict

if # of responsed for a given color exceeds logical limit, split the count

i.e given 3 responses of 1, there can logically be only two responses of 1 in the array for a single color
    meaning that the 3rd response of 1 must be a different color, with 1 other member
